# React Router

    *yarn add react-router-dom@4.1.2

Looks like step one is getting the routes and pages in order in order

    ?what pages do we need
    * for now just AddTopicPage, EditTopicPage, Header, NotesPage, NotFoundPage, TopicsDashboardPage wll with just dummy text for now
Export files to AppRouter and use them with BrowserRouter, Switch, and, Route from react-dom-router to create routes to the pages

Create the corrispondant links in the Header Component
